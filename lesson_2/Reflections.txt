Lesson 2: Problem set 1 reflections

What are the advantages and disadvantages of representing a graph as a list of tuples?

The advantages are that it will help us to no longer need to visually chart out 
all of the nodes on the graph. If there are a large number of nodes, this could
prove time consuming and would be difficult to visualize, with lots of lines
crossing one another. However, the biggest benefit I can think of with a graph
being visually represented, is that it would be more simple to identify whether
each node was even odd. When represented with tuples, you would need to count the
ocurrance of each node among all the tuples.
